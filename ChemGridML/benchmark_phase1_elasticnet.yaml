# FNN (Neural Network) Run: Single Descriptor (ECFP)
# This file temporarily repurposed to run only FNN on ECFP for all targets.
# To run other descriptors sequentially:
#   1) Replace the single entry under `features:` with the next fingerprint name.
#   2) Keep models as ["FNN"].
#   3) Adjust experiment.name if you want a separate DB per descriptor.
# Reverting to baseline: restore original features/models list from version control history.
